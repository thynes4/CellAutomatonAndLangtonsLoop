Project 5 Thomas Hynes

Start by running Main, it will prompt the user to choose either
the One Dimension CA or Langtons Loop.

One Dimension CA:
I was able to completely finish my one dimensional CA that has the ability
to read in data from either a file or direct input.

Langtons Loop:
I was able to completely finish Langtons Loop with functionality to loop when
it reaches a border I created a file init_config_test_border.txt in the langtonsLoop
folder in resources, so you can quickly test the looping across borders
functionality of my Langtons Loop program.
